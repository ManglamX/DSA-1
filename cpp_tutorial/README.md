# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms Lab

Welcome to your personalized C++ DSA Lab! This repository is designed to take you from a C++ beginner to confident in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## How to Use This Lab

The content is organized into modules. For each module:
1.  **Read**: Go to the module folder (e.g., `01_Basics`) and read the `README.md`.
2.  **Learn**: Check the `tutorials/` folder for example code and explanations.
3.  **Practice**: Go to `exercises/` and try to solve the problems. Look for `TODO` comments.
4.  **Verify**: Compare your work with the code in `solutions/`.
