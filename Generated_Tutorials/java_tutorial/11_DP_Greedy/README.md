# Module 11: DP & Greedy

## Overview
Optimization problems usually fall into these two categories.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Dynamic Programming (DP)
- **Memoization** (Caching): Store results of expensive function calls.
- **Tabulation**: Build a table from the bottom up.

### 2. Greedy
- Make the locally optimal choice at each stage.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm is Greedy.

## Your Mission
1.  Run `src/DPFibonacci.java` to see memoization in action.
2.  Complete `exercises/CoinChange.java`.
