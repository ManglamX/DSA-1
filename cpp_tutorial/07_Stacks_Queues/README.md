# Module 07: Stacks & Queues

## Overview
Stacks and Queues are restricted versions of lists. They control *how* data is added and removed.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
Think of a stack of plates. You put one on top (`push`), and you take the top one off (`pop`).
- **Push**: Add to top.
- **Pop**: Remove from top.
- **Top**: Peek at the top element.
- **Use cases**: Function call stack, Undo features, Browser history.

### 2. Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
Think of a line at a store. First person in line is best served first.
- **Enqueue (push)**: Add to back.
- **Dequeue (pop)**: Remove from front.
- **Front**: Peek at the front element.
- **Use cases**: Printer jobs, CPU task scheduling, Breadth-First Search.

## Your Mission
1.  Run `tutorials/01_stack_queue_visualized.cpp`. Watch items pile up!
2.  Complete `exercises/balanced_parentheses.cpp`.
