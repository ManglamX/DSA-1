# Module 11: Graphs

## Overview
Graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) and edges. They model social networks, city maps, and the internet.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Representation
- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array. Fast lookups, uses lots of space.
- **Adjacency List**: List of neighbors for each node. Efficient.

### 2. Traversals
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Explore layer by layer. Uses a Queue. Good for shortest path.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explore as deep as possible. Uses Stack (or Recursion). Good for mazes.

## Your Mission
1.  Run `tutorials/01_bfs_dfs_visualized.cpp`. Watch the graph exploration!
2.  Complete `exercises/number_of_islands.cpp`. A classic interview problem.
