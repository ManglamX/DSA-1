# Module 12: DP & Greedy Algorithms

## Overview
These are advanced techniques for optimization problems.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Greedy Algorithms
"Make the best local choice at each step." 
- Fast and simple.
- Doesn't always find the global optimum (but works for specific problems like Activity Selection, Dijkstra).

### 2. Dynamic Programming (DP)
"Break the problem into overlapping subproblems and store the results."
- **Memoization** (Top-Down): Recursion + Cache.
- **Tabulation** (Bottom-Up): Iteration + Table.
- Used for: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Shortest Paths (Bellman-Ford).

## Your Mission
1.  Run `tutorials/01_dp_fibonacci_visualized.cpp`. See how caching saves time!
2.  Complete `exercises/climbing_stairs.cpp`.
